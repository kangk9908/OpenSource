## Project Description
OpenSource is a platform that allows users to share and build project ideas and program solutions to pertinent problems. Itâ€™s a web app that connects both students and faculty members and provides an avenue for passion projects to be pursued by interested people across different departments. It also allows students to seek clarification on schoolwork and personal projects from knowledgeable faculty and students.

## Project Features
Our web app will allow users to create posts that:
* Request for help with assignments and projects.
* Share a passion project that they would like to build with people.
Users can respond to those posts with images, links, and text to provide solutions. The web app also allows users to create accounts and sign in with usernames and passwords.
